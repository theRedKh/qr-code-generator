# QR Code Generator
 A GUI QR code generator made using `Python`
 
 ##ðŸ“˜ Libraries/Modules
  - `tkinter`
  - `pillow`
  - `os`

## ðŸ“ƒFeatures
 - Generate a qrcode for *any* URL
 - Save, delete and view it
 - QR code is saved in the destination folder of the program

## ðŸŽ¯This project taught me:
 - Using widgets and the grid layout system of `tkinter`
 - Dealing with images in `pillow`
 - Saving and deleting files using `os`

## To make this project better, the next update (if it has one) will have:
 - user control over where the file gets saved
 - converting it to a standalone type app

## Updates:
